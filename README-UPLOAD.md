# TravelVax Pro — GitHub Upload Guide

This folder is already structured so your repository root contains `app/`, `lib/`, `public/`, and the top-level files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.).

## Upload
1) On GitHub → your repo → **Add file → Upload files**.
2) Drag **ALL FILES & FOLDERS** from this folder into the upload page (do **not** drag the folder itself).
3) **Commit changes**.
4) In Vercel, redeploy. Home page `/`, planner at `/plan`.
